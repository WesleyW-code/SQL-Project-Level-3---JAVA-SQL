# SQL-Project-Level-3---JAVA-SQL

Created a Project Manager Using SQL / DATABASES

○ Reads and writes data about projects and people associated with
projects from your database instead of text files. Your program
should not use any text files.
○ Capture information about new projects and add these to the
database.
○ Update information about existing projects.
○ Finalise existing projects. When a project is finalised the following
should happen:

■ An invoice should be generated for the client. This invoice
should contain the customer’s contact details and the total
amount that the customer must still pay. This amount is
calculated by subtracting the total amount paid to date from
the total fee for the project. If the customer has already paid
the full fee, an invoice should not be generated.
■ The project should be marked as “finalised” and the
completion date should be added.

○ Find all projects that still need to be completed from the database.
○ Find all projects that are past the due date from the database.
○ Find and select a project by entering either the project number or
project name.
